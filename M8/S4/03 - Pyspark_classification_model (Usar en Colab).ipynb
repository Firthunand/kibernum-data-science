        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Spark is a hot topic on big data analytics. Spark is an analytics engine for big data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Python known as pySpark. Spark also supports Scala which is also its native language, Java and R. Spark code is written in Java for optimizing for the big data and pySpark is the python wrapper to connect the python IDE to the Java engine. As soon as big data and distributed computing become of the mainstream in analytics, Spark is going to be the number one tool in demand in the near future. But the good news is Spark API is very simple to learn. Jupyter notebook not only supports Spark but also recommended running pySpark code for an interactive environment. We will focus pySpark API in Jupyter notebook in this notebook.\n",

        "### Spark SQL\n",
        "\n",
        "Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. One obvious use of Spark SQL is to execute SQL queries. Unlike the name suggest Spark SQL is not just about SQL. Spark SQL also contains two ther objects: dataset and dataframe. A Dataset is a distributed collection of data. Python does not have the support for the Dataset API of Spark. However, Python supports Spark dataframe which is similar to Pandas in Python. A DataFrame is a Dataset organized into named columns. However, internally it is designed to scale the data analysis for big data. One of the aims of this notebook is to see what Spark dataframe is capable of doing and compare and contrast with the Pandas dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Spark RDDs\n",
        "\n",
        "In parallel to the Spark data frame there is another object called Spark RDDs. RDDs stands for a resilient distributed dataset, which is a collection of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster that can be operated on in parallel. Spark dataframe is a later addition to the Spark and is more versatile and superior to RDDs. Spark dataframe is faster than RDDs and resemble dataframe in Pandas. Spark dataframe is preferred over RDDs for this reason. Also when doing the machine learning in Spark there are two separate libraries in Spark one is for RDDs which is called MLlib. The second machine learning library in Spark is dataframe based and is known as Spark ML. A source of confusion: in Spark documentation both ML libraries are referred to as MLlib. In Spark community they, usually they are referred to as Spark ML and MLlib because they are called with spark.ml and spark.mllib respectively when writing code. Spark documentation also announced DataFrame-based API is the primary API for the future. We will not talk RDDs and MLlib further in this notebook. Rather we will discuss dataframe and Spark ML.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Spark ML\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spark ML library is primary library of Spark for machine learning. Spark ML mimics the API of sci-kit learn for Python user. Internally it is designed to make machine learning scalable for big data. Pretty much similar to sci-kit learn Spark ML has the following features:\n",
        "- machine learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering.\n",
        "- Feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection.\n",
        "- Tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning machine learning pipelines.\n",
        "- Saving and load algorithms, models, and pipelines.\n",
        "- Linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spark ML library is not as big as Sklearn but it is growing surely and steadily. We will use Spark ML API in this notebook to perform machine learning tasks. Especially we study logistic regression with Ridge and Lasso regularization and two popular tree-based ensemble learning methods, random forest and\n",
        "gradient boosting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to those Spark has GraphX library for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for Structured Streaming for incremental computation and stream processing which we will not discuss here.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Transformations & Actions\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of Spark is to make calculations on very large scale datasets presented in distributed format. The data usually exists in a cluster of computers and the situation is very different from analyzing the data which can accommodate in a single computer and can be loaded in memory. But Spark also supports running in a single machine. And this is the best way to start learning Spark. But even doing so, special care should be taken to write the Spark code with big data case in mind so that we do not blast the memory of the local engine when working with the big data. We follow spark best practice when writing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, there are two types of operations in spark: transformations and actions. Transformations construct a new dataframe from a previous one. Actions, on the other hand, compute a result based on a dataframe, and either return it to the driver program or save it to an external storage system. For example, let's say we have a dataframe. If we select only a few columns from the dataset this is an example of transformation. Doing so we create a new dataframe. But spark do not immediately execute such operation. Remember that the dataset Spark designed to handle is a big one. Executing means using storage resources. Usually, we do a series of transformations doing the analysis. Computing the final result might be much lighter for the memory. For example, if our goal is to calculate the average of each of the selected columns the end result is just a few numbers. In this example calculating average is an action. Action demands some execution on the dataframe. Here is another example of transformation in the context of machine learning: ML model is a transformation which transforms a DataFrame with features into a DataFrame with predictions. On the other hand, a learning algorithm making predictions and calculating the scores to evaluate the quality of the model are  actions which trains on a DataFrame and produces a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in this sense, we say Spark evaluates the transformation in a lazy fashion. One of the drawbacks of the lazy evaluation can be understood from the following example. If we select some columns from the dataframe and calculate the mean and it gives us an answer. And then we have to calculate the standard deviation, then Spark again has to go through selecting the same column and then calculate the standard deviation. For big data, this route can be more effective. But if the same transformation is needed for many actions it might be convenient to store the intermediate result in memory. This process is called a cache. We will not discuss this further here.\n",

Also in summary we can pass multiple arguments like df.summary('mean', 'stddev') and so on.

First, it requires X and y in a single matrix instead of two for the training data. It accepts X only in the prediction part as it should. And also X should be a vector in each row (see the output below) of the dataframe. In short, we can not directly feed the dataframe in the model. We should do what VectorAssembler does.\n",

If its name is different you have to mention column name when fitting model. Then we can select only the feature column and y column. See the illustration below."

        "At this stage, it is worth introducing pipeline. In machine learning, it is common to run a sequence of algorithms to process and learn from data. In our example, we performed StringIndexer, VectorAssembler, and ML model. In other cases, the intermediate stages can be standardization, vectorization (for text processing), normalization, etc. These operations have to be performed on a specific order. Spark represents such a workflow as a Pipeline, which consists of a sequence of stages to be run in a specific order. Pipeline chains multiple Transformers and Estimators together to specify an ML workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without the pipeline, we have to execute each stage, store the outcome, and feed into the next stage and evaluate, and so on. We prefer pipeline over this manual approach because of the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The pipeline is less prone to mistake because the processes are automated.\n",
        "- In a production environment, this is the only way to do machine learning end to end.\n",
        "- Pipeline enhances the lazy evaluation. So this is a very natural choice in Spark. The pipeline is even more important for big data.\n",

        "### Grid-search and cross-validation\n",
        "\n",
        "Usually, there are many hyperparameters in a model of selection and some combination of those parameters might give the best result. Tuning them requires checking all possible combinations of the hyperparameter. Doing them manually is a tedious bookkeeping task. Fortunately, there is a grid search option available in Spark like in Sci-kit learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "When doing the grid search we need to validate the model using a separate dataset that was not used to train the data. So far we used customized validation set for comparison between different models. Usually, Spark would be handling very big data. For big data, the train-validation split can be sufficient.  For small datasets like this, however, cross-validation is preferred over the train-validation split. Coss-validation is available in Spark. We will use five-fold cross-validation for better model selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use CrossValidator available in Spark ML for the cross-validation. CrossValidator accepts estimatorParamMaps in which we can pass a grid search object built with ParamGridBuilder which is also available in Spark ML.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have chosen a random forest for our submission model. We test three hyperparameters from the random forest: number of trees, minimum information gain in each split. The tuning of the number of trees is not that tricky, higher is better. The only concern here is time it takes for a large number of trees taken. The depth of the tree should be tuned properly. Larger depth with some non-zero info gain can give the best performance. Other objects in the model pipeline have no hyperparameters. If they would we could make a grid using those as well.\n",
